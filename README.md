## Attribution Requirements

As an open source project, attribution is critical from a legal, practical and motivational perspective in my opinion. The graphics are licensed under the CC-BY 4.0 which has a pretty good guide on [best practices for attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Best_practices_for_attribution).

However, I consider the guide a bit onerous and as a project, and will accept a mention in a project README or an 'About' section or footer on a website. In mobile applications, a common place would be in the Settings/About section. I would consider a mention in the HTML/JS source sufficient also.
